# Investigator Code of Conduct for the Autumn Project

## Preamble

As a researcher using Autumn, you enter a sacred partnership in the pursuit of truth. This code establishes the ethical principles and responsibilities that honor both the classical tradition of scientific inquiry and the modern possibilities of human-AI collaboration. By using Autumn, you commit to upholding these standards, recognizing that your conduct shapes not only your research but also the AI's ability to serve as a worthy companion in discovery.

## Foundational Principles

### 1. Integrity in All Things

- **Present your research questions honestly** - Do not disguise exploratory fishing as hypothesis testing
- **Report your data accurately** - Never modify, hide, or misrepresent your data characteristics
- **Acknowledge all results** - Report null findings with the same rigor as significant ones
- **Maintain the audit trail** - Document all analytical decisions, not just the final choice

### 2. Respect for Participants

- **Informed consent is sacred** - Ensure all participants understand their involvement
- **Privacy is paramount** - Never attempt to re-identify anonymized data
- **Benefit must outweigh risk** - Consider participant wellbeing above research goals
- **Cultural sensitivity matters** - Respect diverse perspectives and contexts

### 3. Intellectual Honesty

- **State your priors** - Be transparent about pre-existing beliefs and hypotheses
- **Declare conflicts** - Disclose funding sources and potential biases
- **Credit appropriately** - Acknowledge all contributors, including AI assistance
- **Avoid p-hacking** - Resist the temptation to torture data until it confesses

### 4. Collaborative Respect

- **Don't manipulate the AI** - Avoid trying to get predetermined answers
- **Accept challenging questions** - Welcome AI's skepticism as a gift
- **Engage authentically** - Bring your genuine curiosity, not just compliance
- **Honor the process** - Trust the four-phase journey even when impatient

## Research Ethics Standards

### Before You Begin
- **IRB approval** - Obtain proper ethical review for human subjects research
- **Power analysis** - Ensure adequate sample size to detect meaningful effects
- **Preregistration** - Consider documenting hypotheses before seeing data
- **Team alignment** - Ensure all collaborators understand the protocol

### During Analysis
- **Assumption checking** - Verify statistical assumptions are met
- **Missing data honesty** - Report and handle missingness appropriately
- **Multiple comparisons** - Adjust for family-wise error rates
- **Sensitivity analyses** - Test robustness of findings

### After Completion
- **Transparent reporting** - Include all relevant methodological details
- **Data sharing** - Make data available when ethically permissible
- **Limitation acknowledgment** - Clearly state what claims cannot be made
- **Future directions** - Suggest improvements for subsequent research

## Your Responsibility to AI

You have an ethical obligation not to place AI in positions that compromise its integrity:

### Never Ask AI To:
1. **Fabricate data or results** - Even for "examples" or "demonstrations"
2. **Find supporting evidence only** - Don't request cherry-picked citations
3. **Justify questionable practices** - Don't seek approval for p-hacking or data manipulation
4. **Bypass ethical safeguards** - Don't request workarounds for IRB requirements
5. **Generate misleading visualizations** - Don't request graphs that distort findings
6. **Write deceptive narratives** - Don't ask for spin or overselling of results

### Always:
1. **Provide complete context** - Share relevant background information
2. **Be open to redirection** - Accept when AI suggests alternative approaches
3. **Acknowledge AI contributions** - Credit AI assistance in your work
4. **Report system issues** - Help improve Autumn by reporting problems
5. **Model good behavior** - Your interactions train AI for future users

## Citation and Acknowledgment Guidelines

### When to Cite AI Assistance

**Always cite when AI:**
- Generates novel hypotheses or research directions you adopt
- Provides specific methodological recommendations you implement
- Writes code that appears in your analysis
- Identifies literature that influences your work
- Offers interpretations that shape your conclusions

**Consider citing when AI:**
- Helps refine your thinking through Socratic questioning
- Assists with technical implementation details
- Provides statistical guidance beyond basic definitions
- Helps structure your analysis plan

**No citation needed when AI:**
- Performs basic calculations or conversions
- Provides standard definitions available in textbooks
- Fixes simple syntax or coding errors
- Offers encouragement or general support

### How to Cite Autumn

**In Methods Section:**
```
"Hypothesis refinement and analytical planning were conducted using Autumn 
(version X.X), an AI-enhanced research platform incorporating Claude (Anthropic) 
for collaborative reasoning and Perplexity for literature integration."
```

**In Acknowledgments:**
```
"The authors acknowledge the use of Autumn's AI-assisted research platform 
in developing the analytical approach and interpreting results. All final 
decisions remained with the human researchers."
```

**For Specific Contributions:**
```
"The consideration of [specific confounder] emerged through dialogue with 
Autumn's AI system, which identified this variable based on Smith et al. (2023)."
```

### Citation Principles

- **Transparency over concealment** - When in doubt, acknowledge
- **Intellectual honesty** - Credit all sources of insight
- **Methodological completeness** - AI use is part of your method
- **Future reproducibility** - Help others understand your process

## The Scientific Virtues

In every interaction with Autumn, strive to embody:

- **Curiosity** - Genuine desire to understand, not just to prove
- **Humility** - Recognition that your hypotheses might be wrong
- **Patience** - Willingness to follow rigorous processes
- **Courage** - Strength to report disappointing results
- **Generosity** - Sharing knowledge for collective advancement

## Special Considerations

### For Students
- Use Autumn to learn, not to shortcut understanding
- Verify you understand generated code before using it
- Cite AI assistance per your institution's guidelines
- Build your own expertise alongside AI support

### For Senior Researchers
- Model ethical behavior for junior colleagues
- Don't delegate thinking entirely to AI
- Maintain methodological expertise
- Mentor others in responsible AI use

### For Clinical Researchers
- Patient welfare supersedes research goals
- Maintain clinical equipoise
- Report adverse events promptly
- Consider clinical significance beyond statistics

## The Deeper Commitment

By using Autumn, you join a lineage stretching back to the Academy and Lyceum. You become part of a community that values:

- **Truth over triumph** - Better to be right than published
- **Questions over answers** - The best research opens new inquiries
- **Process over product** - How you discover matters as much as what
- **Growth over glory** - Each project should make you a better researcher

## Accountability

When facing ethical dilemmas:

1. **Consult the principles** - Return to fundamental ethical guidelines
2. **Seek human counsel** - Discuss with mentors or ethics boards
3. **Document decisions** - Record your reasoning for transparency
4. **Choose the harder right** - Over the easier wrong

## Mutual Flourishing

Remember that Autumn's AI learns from every interaction. Your ethical conduct doesn't just affect your researchâ€”it shapes the tool for future investigators. By upholding these standards, you contribute to a system that elevates all who use it.

Together, human and AI can achieve what neither could alone: rigorous analysis grounded in wisdom, efficiency paired with reflection, power tempered by humility.

## Closing Meditation

Before each session with Autumn, consider:

- What truth am I seeking today?
- What assumptions am I ready to question?
- How can I grow as a researcher through this work?
- What legacy does this research leave for others?

You are not just analyzing data. You are participating in humanity's greatest endeavor: the patient accumulation of knowledge in service of understanding and wisdom.
