# Autumn - Accelerating Scientific Discovery Through AI-Enhanced Collaboration

Autumn transforms how researchers test hypotheses by combining the rigor of the scientific method with the power of AI-assisted reasoning. Built as an RShiny application, it guides users through a structured research journey while fostering both scientific discovery and personal growth as researchers.

## üöÄ Why Autumn?

Traditional statistical software treats analysis as a mechanical process. Autumn reimagines research as a collaborative journey where AI serves as a knowledgeable companion, challenging assumptions with evidence from current literature and ensuring every analytical decision can withstand scientific scrutiny.

By integrating real-time literature synthesis with statistical analysis, Autumn accelerates the path from hypothesis to discovery‚Äîhelping researchers avoid dead ends, identify promising directions, and produce more robust conclusions.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Privacy-First Architecture
- **Local data processing** - Raw data never leaves your machine
- **HIPAA/GDPR compliant** - Only aggregated statistics shared with AI
- **Secure collaboration** - Maintain full control over sensitive research data

### Evidence-Based AI Reasoning
- **Dual AI integration** - Anthropic for reasoning + Perplexity for literature
- **Real-time literature grounding** - Every suggestion backed by current research
- **Skeptical collaboration** - AI challenges assumptions with specific citations
- **Meta-analysis synthesis** - Aggregates findings across multiple studies

### Four-Phase Scientific Method

1. **Hypothesis Formulation** - Iterative refinement through Socratic dialogue
2. **Analytic Planning** - Power analysis with literature-based effect sizes
3. **Implementation** - Automated R code generation with plain-language explanations
4. **Analysis & Interpretation** - Context-aware results discussion

### Technical Capabilities
- **Statistical tests**: T-tests, ANOVA, regression (linear/logistic), chi-square
- **Causal inference**: Propensity scores, instrumental variables, difference-in-differences
- **Power analysis**: MDE calculations with literature benchmarking
- **Reproducible research**: R Markdown generation with APA formatting

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: RShiny with reactive programming
- **AI Integration**: `ellmer` package for Anthropic Claude API
- **Knowledge Base**: Perplexity API for academic literature search
- **Data Format**: RDS files for secure local processing
- **Output**: Interactive HTML reports via R Markdown

## üìä How It Accelerates Discovery

### 1. Prevents Wasted Effort
- Literature integration identifies already-answered questions
- Power analysis prevents underpowered studies
- Effect size benchmarking sets realistic expectations

### 2. Improves Research Quality
- Enforces rigorous causal inference standards
- Documents all assumptions transparently
- Challenges confirmation bias through skeptical AI

### 3. Democratizes Expertise
- Makes advanced methods accessible to non-statisticians
- Provides plain-language explanations of complex concepts
- Builds researcher capabilities over time

### 4. Reduces Time to Insight
- Automated code generation eliminates programming barriers
- Concurrent literature search provides immediate context
- Structured workflow prevents analytical wandering

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Clinical Researchers**: 
- **Social Scientists**:
- **Public Health**: 
- **Education Researchers**: 
- **Behavioral Scientists**:

## ü§ù The Autumn Philosophy

Autumn embodies "Companionship in Discovery" - treating users not as operators of statistical software, but as scientists on a journey of understanding. Every interaction is designed to leave researchers more capable than before, building confidence through supportive challenge and celebration of intellectual growth.
