Continue Autumn UI/UX Implementation - Priority 2 Tasks

Quick Briefing

I'm working on the Autumn Scientific Methods Engine, an R
   Shiny application that guides users through rigorous
  hypothesis testing using AI collaboration (Anthropic +
  Perplexity APIs).

  What we accomplished today:
  - ✅ Fixed API connectivity issues by updating deprecated
   model names
  - ✅ Implemented dynamic model selection interface with
  real-time switching
  - ✅ Added comprehensive model selection dropdowns in the
   AI Assistant Status panel
  - ✅ Updated all documentation to reflect new features
  and troubleshooting guidance
  - ✅ Completed Priority 1 UI/UX tasks (chat-centric
  interface improvements)

  Current State:
  - Both Anthropic and Perplexity APIs are working
  correctly with current model names
  - Model selection functionality is fully implemented and
  tested
  - Priority 1 UI/UX improvements are complete (expanded
  chat, floating input, hidden redundant controls)
  - All documentation is updated and comprehensive

  Your Task

  Please implement Priority 2: Visual Breathing Room from
  the UI/UX todo list. Focus on creating a calming,
  spacious interface that aligns with the "Companionship in
   Discovery" design philosophy.

  Specific Priority 2 Tasks to Complete:

  2.1 Implement Soft Visual Language

  - Update www/styles.css with rounded corners, soft
  shadows, and warm background
  - Remove harsh borders, use subtle box-shadows instead

  2.2 Increase Message Spacing

  - Improve chat message padding and line-height for better
   readability
  - Add more breathing room between messages

  2.3 Implement Calming Color Palette

  - Add CSS custom properties for the Autumn color scheme
  - Apply warm, muted colors throughout the interface

  Key Files to Work With:
  - www/styles.css (primary focus)
  - app.r (for any UI structure changes needed)
  - Reference doc/uiux-design-principles.md for design
  philosophy
  - Update todo/uiux-implementation-todo-list.md to mark
  completed tasks

  Design Principles:
  - Create visual calm and intellectual safety
  - Use warm, muted colors that feel inviting
  - Emphasize spaciousness and breathing room
  - Support the feeling of "companionship in discovery"

  Testing:
  - Verify responsive behavior at different screen sizes
  - Ensure changes work well with existing model selection
  UI
  - Test that the warmer visual style enhances rather than
  distracts from the AI collaboration experience

  Start with task 2.1 and work through 2.3 systematically.
  Update the todo list as you complete each subtask.
